[CheckUpOn.Me](https://checkupon.me) provides a text-distribution and outreach tool called Spoke for creating connections between volunteers and people who would like to be checked in on. During the COVID-19 pandemic our goal is to help where it's needed most by connecting people in need with volunteers who will be ready to take action. This user manual will go over the basic operating details for Spoke. 

# Getting Started with Spoke

To get started with this guide you will need access to a spoke instance. You can either set one up yourself with the directions in the spoke repo or you can drop in on [slack](https://ckup.me/slack) and request access to one of our instances.

Through Spoke, you can organize texting [campaigns](), which provide the structure and tools needed to connect [texters](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/32-user-roles) in your organization with your contacts. Spoke is meant to be used in combination with a CRM. Spoke is not a CRM and should not be used as one.

Spoke's key features include:

- Messaging platform with script and survey integration
- Interaction script and survey editing
- Auto, dynamic, and manual conversation assignment
- Automatic handling and processing of your contact lists
- Opt-out handling

To begin learning about Spoke, see [Using this documentation](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/23-using-this-documentation).

## Invite texters to Spoke

You invite texters to Spoke by sending them a invitation link. When someone clicks on the link, they can create a texter account. After texters create their accounts, you can assign user roles to them.

To invite texters to join your organization on Spoke:

1. From the administration dashboard, navigate to the **People** page.
2. Click the **Add** button.
3. Copy the URL.
4. Share the URL with the texters you want to invite.

When someone clicks on the link, they will be able to create an account.

## Assign user roles

[User roles](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/32-user-roles) can be assigned from the "People" page of the [administration dashboard](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/52-dashboards). After you [invite texters](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/65-invite-texters-to-spoke) to your Spoke organization, users are automatically listed with the default **Texter** role.

To change a user's role:

1. From the "People" page, click the arrow next to the role name.
2. Select a new role. For more information about the different user roles, see [User roles](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/32-user-roles).

## Campaigns

Campaigns are the central feature of Spoke. They provide the structure and tools for [texters](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/32-user-roles) to engage in conversations with your contacts.

Each campaign has a [contact list](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/25-campaigns) and an [interaction script](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/25-campaigns). When you start a campaign, contacts are assigned to texters, who can then initiate a conversation using the interaction script. 

A campaign should have a single purpose -- for example, to inform your contacts of an event or to ask about issue priority -- so that you can tailor your interaction script to properly convey that information. You can run multiple campaigns simultaneously to reach your contacts about different things.

If you are a Spoke administrator, you can manage campaigns from the [administration dashboard](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/52-dashboards).

# Text a contact

After you have [requested and received conversation assignments](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/41-request-texts-for-assignment), you can begin texting contacts.

## Send initial messages

To send an initial message:

1. Open the [texter dashboard](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/52-dashboards).

2. Click **Send first texts**.

3. Click **Send**.

   > Note: You cannot edit the initial message.

Following this procedure takes the conversation out of your to-do list. When the contact responds, the conversation will reappear under the **Send replies** category.

## Send replies

To send replies to contacts who have responded to an initial message:

1. Open the [texter dashboard](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/52-dashboards).
2. Click **Send replies**.
3. Answer the survey question. This fills the message field with a prepared response.
4. (Optional) Edit the message as needed. We recommend using the response that your Spoke administrators have carefully crafted for you.
5. Click **Send**.

Following this procedure takes the conversation out of your to-do list. When the contact responds, the conversation will re-enter your to-do list.

This is the standard procedure for sending a reply. In certain cases, you might need to do one of the following when crafting a reply:

- [Skip the reply](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/80-skip-a-reply)
- [Use a canned response](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/74-use-canned-response)
- [Opt out the contact](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/73-opt-out-a-contact)
- [Add a tag to the conversation](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/58-add-tags-to-a-conversation)
- [Escalate the conversation](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/81-escalate-a-conversation)

## Request texts for assignment

If you are a [texter](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/32-user-roles) for your organization, you can request text assignments to start conversations with contacts.

To request texts:

1. Open the texter [dashboard](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/52-dashboards).
2. In the **Count** field, specify the number of conversations you want assigned to you. If there are no unassigned conversations, a message will be displayed.
3. Click **Request More Texts**.

## Add tags to a conversation

Adding tags to a conversation allows your Spoke administrators to keep informed about your contacts. You can use tags to indicate your contact's primary language, or you can use tags to [escalate a conversation](https://docs.spokerewired.com/article/81-escalate-a-conversation). For information on how you should be using tags, contact your Spoke administrators.

To add a tag to a conversation:

1. From an open conversation, click **Manage tags**.
2. Choose one or more tags from the list. You cannot create your own tag. 
3. Click **Save**.

## Opt out a contact

Opting out a contact adds them to your organization's opt-out list. This prevents you from sending more messages to the contact. All future campaigns automatically remove contacts who are on the opt-out list.

### Opt out with a message

Opting out a contact with a message allows you to apologize for the inconvenience.

To opt-out a contact with a followup message:

1. While in a conversation, click **Opt-out**.
2. Either enter your own followup message, or use the one automatically provided.
3. Click **Send**.

### Opt out without a message

Opting out a contact without a message prevents you from disturbing them further.

To opt-out a contact without a followup message:

1. While in a conversation, click **Opt-out**.
2. Delete the message that's automatically provided.
3. Click **Opt out without text**.

## Use a canned response

Canned responses are messages prepared for you by your Spoke administrators. You can use these in case a conversation goes off script.

To use a canned response:

1. From a conversation, click **Canned responses**.
2. Click the canned response you want to use.
3. (Optional) Edit the response as needed.
4. Click **Send**.

## Skip a reply

Skipping a reply allows you to move onto the next conversation without sending a reply to a contact. You can return to conversations that you skipped using the **Skipped messages** button on the texter dashboard.

To skip a reply:

1. From a conversation, click **Skip reply**, as shown in the following figure:

![Skip Reply](http://checkupon.me/docs/images/skipreply.jpg)

## Escalate a conversation

Escalating a conversation brings it to the attention of your Spoke administrators, allowing them to take appropriate action. In general, use the escalate tag when you need someone to help you out with a conversation, but ask your Spoke administrators about when they think it's appropriate.

To escalate a conversation:

1. From an active conversation, click **Manage tags**.
2. Click **Escalate conversation**.
3. Click **Save**.

## Include an image in a message

You can include images with your messages to send event posters or other media to your contacts. 

> Note: Multimedia messages cost more to send than text-only messages. Ask your organization for guidelines and permission.

To include images with your messages:

1. From a conversation, paste a URL between two square brackets, [ ]. For example: `[https://image-url.com/image-is-here]`.
2. Write a message to be sent with the image. Any text before and after the bracketed URL is combined into a single message with the bracketed URL removed.
3. Click **Send**.

### Size limitations

Cellular carriers have different limitations on MMS attachments. We recommend keeping attachment size below **600 KB** for best results.

Size limitations for the top 4 US carriers are:

| **Carrier** | **MMS attachment size** |
| ----------- | ----------------------- |
| AT&T        | 1.4 MB                  |
| Sprint      | 1.4 MB                  |
| T-mobile    | 0.675 MB                |
| Verizon     | 0.675 MB                |

### Send an image with links

The SMS/MMS protocol, regardless of provider, does not support hyperlinked images. If you want to provide a link with an accompanying image, you can add [meta tags for social media](https://css-tricks.com/essential-meta-tags-social-media/) to the linked website itself, and then send the link. These tags let messaging applications show a preview of the linked content. For example, this is how YouTube link previews are displayed.

If you don't have control of the linked website, you can create an intermediate page that redirects to the destination page [using a refresh tag](https://www.lifewire.com/meta-refresh-tag-3469046). Then, you can add meta tags to the intermediate page.
